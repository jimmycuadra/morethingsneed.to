== colorized_test

This plugin is very simple. Heavily based on Pat Eyler's redgreen gem, 
it redefines Test::Unit TestRunner to add ANSI escape sequences to 
test run output.

ColorizedTest is tested on both Linux and Windows, latter requires
installation of 'win32console' gem.

=== Usage

Any rake test task should have colorized output if you set environment
variable COLORIZE to any non-false value. eg.

  $ rake test:units COLORIZE=1

or 

  $ rake test:all_but_integration COLORIZE=1

or 

  $ export COLORIZE=doitplease
  $ rake any_test_task
  $ ruby any_test_file

all should work and result in colored output.

=== TODO

* colored output can be turned on or off in some config file too,
  environment variable having precedence

* have redgreen gem accept the light attrib patch and require redgreen as
  dependency

* create some real plugin

=== Licence

Released under the MIT license.

=== Credits

* Pat Eyler and ErrTheBlog folks, especially the former for the
  redgreen gem
* Ryan Heath for ideas
